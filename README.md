# JamesShopland.com

I use this site to test new things. Redesigning it in whatever framework I would like to learn.

Currently the site was built with React and TailwindCSS using Gatsby.

# Azure Cloud

Parts of this site were built for a seperate domain, jamesshopland.cloud

This site is a playground for my testing of Azure cloud services
