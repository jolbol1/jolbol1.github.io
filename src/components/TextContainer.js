          I started coding over 10 years ago in Java, developing plugins for
          games I liked. Since then I have always had an interest in all things
          tech, from microcontrollers to full-stack development. The combination
          of problem solving and creativity continue to fuel my passion in the
          rapidly changing field of technology.
