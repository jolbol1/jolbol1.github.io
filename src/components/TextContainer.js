        I started coding over 10 years ago in Java, developing plugins for games
        I liked. Since then I have always had an interest in all things tech,
        from microcontrollers to full-stack development. The combination of
        problem solving and creativity continue to fuel my passion in the
        rapidly changing field of technology.
